# Hu Group @ USTC

**High-Performance Intelligent Quantum Computational Chemistry**

## Overview
The Hu Group develops advanced **numerical methods** and **first-principles software** for
large-scale electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.
Our research targets **supercomputing** and **quantum computing** platforms, with an emphasis on
accuracy, scalability, and algorithm–architecture co-design.

## Research Directions
- Large-scale density functional theory (DFT)
- Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
- Electronic structure of complex and strongly correlated systems
- High-performance numerical algorithms
- First-principles software development for HPC
- Quantum computing for chemistry and materials
- AI-assisted materials simulation and intelligent agents

## Software
The Hu Group develops and maintains first-principles electronic structure software, including:

- **KSSOLV**  
  A MATLAB-based research platform for developing and testing numerical algorithms for
  Kohn–Sham density functional theory, with a focus on iterative solvers, eigensolvers,
  and algorithmic prototyping.

- **PWDFT**  
  A plane-wave density functional theory package emphasizing algorithmic clarity and
  high-performance implementations for large-scale electronic structure calculations.

- **DGDFT**  
  A discontinuous Galerkin density functional theory framework designed for
  massively parallel, large-scale simulations of complex materials systems on modern
  supercomputing architectures.

Most repositories are research-oriented and may evolve rapidly.

## Computing Platforms
- CPU/GPU-based supercomputers
- Large-scale parallel and heterogeneous architectures
- Emerging quantum and hybrid computing platforms

## Collaboration
We welcome academic collaboration and technical discussion in the areas of
